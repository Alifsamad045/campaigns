# Commons campaigns

Stores data about Commons campaigns such as Wiki Loves Monuments.

Campaigns will be displayed by the [Commons Android app](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/) using this information.

# Adding a campaign

If a campaign is not documented yet, or to modify the dates or URL, please:

1. Edit both [campaigns.json](https://github.com/commons-app/campaigns/edit/master/campaigns.json) and [prod/campaigns.json](https://github.com/commons-app/campaigns/edit/master/campaigns.json). NB: This is temporary while we migrate (see [apps-android-commons#2793](https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/2793)).
2. Make sure your JSON file is valid by pasting it into a JSON validator such as [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com).
3. Press the "Commit" button.
4. Press the "Send pull request" button.
5. In the pull request description, provide a source for the information, for instance a link to an announcement or wiki discussion.
6. We will review your contribution and merge it.

Thanks!
